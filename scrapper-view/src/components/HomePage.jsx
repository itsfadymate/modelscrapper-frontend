      question: "What is the 3D Model Scrapper App?",
      answer: "The 3D Model Scrapper App is a comprehensive tool that searches across multiple 3D model websites to find models related to your search terms. It aggregates results from popular platforms like Thingiverse, Printables, Thangs, MyMiniFactory, and Cults3D in one convenient location."
    },
    {
      question: "Which websites does the app scrape?",
      answer: "Currently, the app scrapes models from Thingiverse, Printables, Thangs, MyMiniFactory, Cults3D, GrabCad and Sketchfab. You can filter your search to include or exclude specific websites based on your preferences."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the optimized search work?",
      answer: "The app uses a custom search engine that optimizes queries for each website."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I need to know about optimized search?",
      answer: "It is more likely to fetch relevant results than the normal search. However for the following websites:\n"+
      " - GrabCad\n"+
      " - Printables\n"+
      " - Thangs\n"+
      "It significantly cuts down search time, however it leaves out data about likes, comments, make count and wether the model is featured or not. \n"+
      "For the other websites search time is slower but all data is fetched as traditional search.\n\n"+
      "N.B.: If the optimized search failed this means the API quota for the day has been reached, you can try again tomorrow or use the normal search." 
    },
    {
      question: "Can I download models directly through the app?",
      answer: "Only Free Models. Currently direct downloads are supported for Thingiverse, Printables, Cults3D, and MyMiniFactory."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I use the 3D viewer?",
      answer: "Click the '3D View' button on any model.\n"+
      "For websites for which direct download is implemented, kirimoto slicer is opened and loads the STL files directly if they exist.\n"+
      "For other websites, if a 3D view option is available it is loaded."
    },
    {
      question: "Why are some buttons disabled?",
      answer: "The '3D View' button is disabled for websites that do not support direct downloads or do not have a 3D viewer available. This is to ensure that you only attempt to view models in a compatible format.\n"+
      "The view details button is disabled for websites for which detail fetching is not implemented."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the app on mobile devices?",
      answer: "Yes, the 3D Model Scrapper App is designed to be responsive and works on most mobile devices. However, for the best experience, it is recommended to use a tablet or desktop."
